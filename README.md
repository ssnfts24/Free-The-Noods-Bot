Features

Dynamic Battles:
Engage in multi-phase battles with enemies like the Scarling. Players can use interactive commands (e.g., !counter, !dodge, !block, and !finish) to influence battle outcomes.

Player Progression:
Create and level up profiles with attributes (strength, agility, luck), XP, points, and rescued noods. Upgrade your stats and manage your health.

Advanced Inventory System:
Collect items with varying rarities and effects. Some items may grant bonuses in battle or be used in other commands.

In-Game Marketplace:
List items for sale, browse active listings, purchase items, and negotiate trades. The marketplace features dynamic pricing, negotiation history, and listing expiry.

Trade & Negotiation:
Direct trade commands allow players to exchange items, while negotiation functions simulate multi-round negotiations for better prices.

Rich Storytelling & Random Events:
Immerse yourself in atmospheric environments with dynamic random events that add depth to exploration and battles.

Modular Architecture:
Built with Discord.js v14, MongoDB, and modular command/event loading. Advanced logging and graceful shutdown handling are implemented for production readiness.

Listing Expiry:
Listings expire automatically after a set period (default: 7 days).


For detailed marketplace functionality, see the Marketplace Utilities file.

Development & Testing

Logging:
Winston is used for advanced logging. Check bot.log for detailed logs.

CI/CD:
Consider setting up GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, and deployment.
